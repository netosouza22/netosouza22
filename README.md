  <h3>Hi, it's me! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Hi, I'm Neto and I'm a front end developer, I'm from Brazil, I like the path I chose because I believe that technology can create changes in the place where it was inserted.

Most part of time I'm using frontend technologies, I really like to create something beautiful and useful, usually using React Js, Vue Js or Vanilla Js to make my things, and for now trying to improve myself and my skills (you know, the hard and soft) and one day I'm going to study backend, I think it's important to know every part of web development.
